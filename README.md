# Stoxy

### This is still an ongoing project, more features will be added.

##### This is a simple stock adviser which gives calls by analysing stock charts.
##### The web app basically fetches the stock's technical indicator data from twelevdata API and the data is analysed to return either a BUY, SELL or HOLD call.
##### Alphavantage API is also used for some helpful company related data but the endpoint isn't returning any data recently so the feature was removed in the latest build.
##### This project is severely limited because there aren't many reliable free apis for stock data and this is also the reason why it only supports the US stock market.

## Commands to run
